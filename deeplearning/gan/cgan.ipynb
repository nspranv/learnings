    "Till now we have seen how to generate images using GANs. But what if we want to generate images of a specific type? For example, we want to generate images of a specific digit. In such cases, we can use Conditional GANs (CGANs). In CGANs, we provide the generator and discriminator with additional information, called the condition, which helps them to generate images of a specific type.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example let's say we want to generate images of digit 5. In this case, we can provide the generator and discriminator with the label of digit 5. The generator will generate images of digit 5 and the discriminator will classify the images as real or fake.\n",
    "\n",
    "How we will provide the label to the generator and discriminator? We will concatenate the label with the noise vector and provide it as input to the generator. Similarly, we will concatenate the label with the image and provide it as input to the discriminator. \n",
    "\n",
    "And label is converted to one-hot encoded vector. For example, if the label is 5, then it will be converted to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. \n",
    "\n",
    "And we use nn.Embedding layer to represent the label. nn.Embedding is similar to nn.Linear layer. It takes the label as input and returns the corresponding embedding vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the label is 5, then the embedding layer will return the embedding vector of 5. This embedding vector is then concatenated with the noise vector and provided as input to the generator. Similarly, the embedding vector is concatenated with the image and provided as input to the discriminator. \n",

    "The choice of stride in convolutional layers affects the spatial dimensions of the feature maps produced after convolution. Here's why the stride is set to 1 initially and then changed to 2 in subsequent layers in the generator network:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial Layer with Stride 1:\n",
    "When the stride is set to 1, the convolutional operation moves the filter/kernel one pixel at a time across the input feature map. This results in output feature maps with the same spatial dimensions as the input feature maps but potentially with different channel dimensions due to the number of output filters.\n",
    "Setting the stride to 1 in the initial layer helps preserve the spatial information of the input noise vector. Since the initial noise vector typically contains low-level features or patterns that are important for generating the overall structure of the output image, preserving spatial details in the early stages of generation can be beneficial.\n",
    "Subsequent Layers with Stride 2:\n",
    "As the generator network progresses through its layers, it aims to learn increasingly abstract and high-level features. Using a stride of 2 in subsequent layers reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps while increasing the number of channels, effectively \"zooming out\" and capturing broader patterns and structures in the data.\n",
    "By reducing the spatial dimensions with larger strides, the generator can focus on capturing higher-level semantic information and global context, which are crucial for generating coherent and realistic images.\n",
    "Additionally, increasing the stride in deeper layers can help control the growth of computational complexity and memory requirements, as it reduces the spatial resolution of feature maps and hence the number of parameters in subsequent layers."

    "\n",
    "        1. Reshaping the Labels Tensor:\n",
    "        Initially, the labels tensor has a shape of (batch_size, num_classes), where batch_size is the number of samples in the batch, and num_classes is the number of classes or categories.\n",
    "        To make the labels tensor compatible with the image tensor, which typically has dimensions (batch_size, channels, height, width), we reshape the labels tensor to have dimensions (batch_size, num_classes, 1, 1).\n",
    "        This reshaping essentially adds two extra dimensions to the labels tensor, turning it into a 4D tensor where each label becomes a \"channel\" in the spatial dimensions.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        2. Repeating Along Height and Width:\n",
    "        Since the labels tensor has been reshaped to match the spatial dimensions of the image tensor, we now need to ensure that the labels are repeated across the entire spatial extent of each image.\n",
    "        To achieve this, we use the repeat() function to repeat the labels along the height and width dimensions of the image tensor.\n",
    "        For example, if the original images have spatial dimensions of 28x28, and we want each label to cover the entire spatial area of the corresponding image, we repeat the labels tensor 28 times along both the height and width dimensions.\n",
    "        This ensures that each pixel in the generated image is associated with the appropriate label, allowing the discriminator network to learn to distinguish between different classes at each spatial location.\n",
